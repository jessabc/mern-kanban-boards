## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- Bonus: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- Bonus: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (localStorage could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Hook Form
- React Beautiful DND
- MongoDb / Mongoose
- Express
- Node.js


### What I learned

- Using React Hook Form, and React Beautiful DND
- Custom hooks
- Clicking outside modal to close the modal
- Slide animation for menu
- MERN

### Continued development

- This is the biggest project I have built, I would like to become more comfortable resuing custom hooks and components as found I was copy and pasting/ repeating alot of code.
- I would also like to get more comfortable using Tailwind CSS and was using a mixutre of Tailwind CSS and vanilla CSS here.
- I would like to learn more about React Hook Form, as I still found it confusing it parts and didn't fully understand what was happening.
